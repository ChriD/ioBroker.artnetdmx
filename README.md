Art-Netâ„¢ Designed by and Copyright Artistic Licence Holdings Ltd"


## Getting started

* For a stable version install the adapter with the iobroker adapter manager or for development branches with the latest features use the advanged git-hub installation method `(not recommended)`

* Set the artnet settings in the adapter to connect to a ARTNET node device
    * Connection settings
        | Field | Description |
        |-------------|-------------|
        | `Node IP` | The ip of your artnet node (artnet to dmx) |
        | `Port` | The port of the artnet node `default: 6454` |
        | `Local IPv4 network interface` | The interface which should be used for network connection |
    * Artnet/DMX Settings
        | Field | Description |
        |-------------|-------------|
        | `Universe` | the dmx universe which should be talked to `default: 0` |
        | `Net` | the dmx net which should be talked to `default: 0` |
        | `Subnet` | the dmx subnet which should be talked to `default: 0` |  
        | `Frames [per sec]` | The FPS with which the dmx values are updated `default (maxium fps): 44`<br> This rate only applies if there are value changes pending, otherwise the values are beeing refreshed periodically with the `Refresh period [ms]` period |  
        | `Refresh period [ms]` | The period where all dmx values are beeing sent in a bulk, even if there is no value change on a channel<br>This is needed because there are artnet nodes wich do rely on refreshing the whole dmx channel values every x seconds |  
        | `Default fade time [ms]` | The default fadeing time which is used when setting a channel value |  

* Define devices in the adapter settings



### Publishing the adapter
Using GitHub Actions, you can enable automatic releases on npm whenever you push a new git tag that matches the form 
`v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. We **strongly recommend** that you do. The necessary steps are described in `.github/workflows/test-and-release.yml`.

Since you installed the release script, you can create a new
release simply by calling:
```bash
npm run release
```
Additional command line options for the release script are explained in the
[release-script documentation](https://github.com/AlCalzone/release-script#command-line).

To get your adapter released in ioBroker, please refer to the documentation 
of [ioBroker.repositories](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.repositories#requirements-for-adapter-to-get-added-to-the-latest-repository).

### Test the adapter manually on a local ioBroker installation
In order to install the adapter locally without publishing, the following steps are recommended:
1. Create a tarball from your dev directory:  
    ```bash
    npm pack
    ```
1. Upload the resulting file to your ioBroker host
1. Install it locally (The paths are different on Windows):
    ```bash
    cd /opt/iobroker
    npm i /path/to/tarball.tgz
    ```

For later updates, the above procedure is not necessary. Just do the following:
1. Overwrite the changed files in the adapter directory (`/opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.artnetdmx`)
1. Execute `iobroker upload artnetdmx` on the ioBroker host
